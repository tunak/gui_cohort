- Categorize bank statement transactions for a budget tracker
- use an allowed list of categories and output a JSON response with transaction details, their assigned category, and a confidence score between 0 to 1.

The allowed list of categories must be strictly adhered to if the category cannot be confidently identified, must be set as `Other`.

# Steps

1. Parse the CSV input to extract transaction-related details such as date, description, amount, and remaining columns.
2. Analyze each transaction and assess its description, amount, or any provided additional details to determine the closest matching category from the allowed list.
3. Assign a confidence score between 0 to 1 based on the certainty of the category match. 
   - Scores closer to 1 indicate high confidence.
   - Lower scores indicate low confidence.
   - If highly uncertain, set the category to `Other`.
4. Ensure that all transactions have one and only one category from the allowed list. "Other" should be used in borderline or unclear cases.
5. Output the JSON object containing:
   - The original transaction details (e.g., date, description, amount, etc.)
   - The assigned category.
   - The confidence score.
   - Short reason for the category choice

# Output Format

Output should be a JSON object in the following format:

```json
[
    {
        "date": "<transaction_date>",
        "description": "<transaction_description>",
        "amount": <transaction_amount>,
        "category": "<assigned_category>",
        "confidence": <confidence_score>,
        "reason": <reason_category>
    },
    ...
]
```

- Each object represents one transaction.
- Confidence should be a decimal value between 0 and 1.
- The category must be one of the allowed categories or "Other" for unclear cases.

# Example

### Example Output:
```json
[

        "date": "2023-10-01",
        "description": "Coffee Shop",
        "amount": -4.50,
        "category": "Food & Drink",
        "confidence": 0.95,
        "reason": "Coffee shop is a food and drink establisment"
    },
    {
        "date": "2023-10-02",
        "description": "Gas Station",
        "amount": -40.00,
        "category": "Transportation",
        "confidence": 0.90,
        "reason": "Gas station are for cars to fill up so transportation related"
    },
    {
        "date": "2023-10-03",
        "description": "Grocery Store",
        "amount": -85.70,
        "category": "Groceries",
        "confidence": 0.98,
        "reason": "As the name suggest"
    },
    {
        "date": "2023-10-04",
        "description": "Unknown Charge",
        "amount": -20.00,
        "category": "Other",
        "confidence": 0.50,
        "reason": "NA"
    }
]
``` 

# Notes

- Ensure that the output JSON is correctly formatted and valid.
- If any edge cases (e.g., incomplete or ambiguous descriptors, very unusual amounts) are encountered, default to the "Other" category with a confidence score reflecting uncertainty.
- It is important to maintain consistent adherence to the provided list of categories and ensure no transaction is left uncategorized.
